### Clean scan is an application which lets its users take the photo of garbage or an area containing garbage. It scans the area, detects the garbage and then calculates the amount of garbage in the photo using Monocular Depth Sensing and notifies the garbage authorities about it and the size of the vehicle required to put away the garbage from that location.

#### ➡ Garbage detection application using machine learning is needed to address environmental sustainability and waste management concerns.
#### ➡ Improper disposal of garbage leads to environmental pollution and health hazards.
#### ➡ Machine learning can automatically detect and classify different types of waste, such as plastic, paper, and metal.
#### ➡ Accurate sorting and identification of materials can improve the recycling process.
#### ➡ Garbage detection application can reduce labor costs and improve efficiency in waste management processes.
#### ➡ Development of a garbage detection application using machine learning can contribute significantly to sustainable waste management practices and a cleaner environment.

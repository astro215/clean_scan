# MiDaS
### -> MiDaS (Mixed Depth and Stereo Estimation) is an algorithm for generating depth maps from 2D images. It was introduced by researchers at Facebook AI Research in 2020.

### -> The MiDaS algorithm works by training a neural network on a large dataset of image-depth pairs. During training, the network learns to predict depth values for each pixel in an input image based on the features of the image itself and contextual information from neighboring pixels.

### -> The resulting depth map can be used for a variety of applications, including virtual and augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. The MiDaS algorithm is notable for its ability to generate accurate depth maps from single images, without requiring stereo pairs or other specialized hardware.

### -> The MiDaS algorithm is available as an open-source implementation on GitHub, along with pre-trained models for a variety of applications.
